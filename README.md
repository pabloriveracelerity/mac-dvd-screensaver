# dvd screensaver

Bouncy dvd screensaver with a fun twist based on this work:

- https://github.com/nikital/screensaver
- https://nikital.github.io/screensaver/

Why?

I was reading a Hacker News thread when the person who built the thing listed above linked to a demo.

Made 100% sense to build a mac screensaver based on their work.

No intention to steal work or glory is meant.
